Automate Detection of Different Sentiments from Paragraphs and Predict Overall Sentiment

Project 1 :-  
In this project I have used IMDB Dataset for predicting the sentiment of a particular movie review, whether that movie has a positive review or a negative review.
In this I’ve used three different types of deep neural networks, they are:
1. Densely connected Neural Network (Basic Neural network).
2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
3. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)


Importantly in this project I’ve also used Keras Embedding Layer and GloVe word embeddings to convert text to numeric form.

1. When I used Simple Neural Network then I got test accuracy of 73.61%.

2. When I used CNN then I got test accuracy of 83.46%.

3. When I used LSTM then I got test accuracy of 84.75%.
